YouTube Clone Project
This project is a basic clone of YouTube's user interface, built using HTML and CSS. It mimics the layout of the YouTube homepage, including the header, sidebar, and video grid.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following main files:

index.html - The main HTML file that defines the structure of the page.
styles/general.css - Contains general CSS styles for layout and design.
styles/header.css - Contains CSS specifically for styling the header section of the page.
styles/video.css - Contains CSS for styling the video grid and individual video elements.
styles/sidebar.css - Contains CSS for styling the sidebar section.
Features
Header Section: Includes a search bar, user profile, notifications, and app icons.
Sidebar: Provides quick navigation links such as Home, Explore, Subscriptions, Library, etc.
Video Grid: Displays a list of videos with thumbnails, titles, and channel info.
Responsive Design: The page layout adjusts based on the screen size (thanks to the CSS media queries).
